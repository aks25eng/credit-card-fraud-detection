AIM:- The aim is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:

1- Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.

2- Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones


## How to tackle these challenges?

1- The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible.

2- Imbalance can be dealt with by choosing the same amount of legit data as that of fraud data.
